Footnotes:
1,"To ensure the confidentiality of the Zero-Emission Vehicles (ZEV) data, a process known as Random Tabular Adjustment (RTA) was used. This changes estimates by a random amount and adds a degree of uncertainty to the accuracy of the estimate to prevent the disclosure of individual values. As a result, estimates that could disclose an individual's response are not released. (Note that if the adjusted estimates are part of a table with totals or sub-totals, the related total and sub-total estimates will also be adjusted.)"
2,"Total vehicle type excludes buses, trailers, recreational vehicles, motorcycles, snowmobiles, golf carts, etcetera."
3,"Data for Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Alberta are currently not available due to contractual limitations of the existing data sharing agreement."
